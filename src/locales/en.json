Import Children - Import children from the birthday list or add manually\n2. Set Age Groups - Define age groups and amount per group\n3. Set Budget - Set number of participants and allowed overflow percentage, or enter a custom budget\n4. Automatic Calculation - The system calculates the required amount for each group and each child\n5. Save Budget Profiles - Save settings for reuse\n\nBudget Profiles:\n• Each profile saves age groups, budget settings, and custom settings (if any)\n• Important: The birthday list is not saved in the profile - only the settings are saved\n• If the birthday list changes, the profile remains and distributes the same way even when the list grows\n• You can save up to 10 different budget profiles\n• Set one profile as default to load automatically\n• Load a saved profile to quickly apply settings\n\nThe system automatically calculates the optimal distribution of the budget among groups while maintaining multiples of 5 ILS.",
